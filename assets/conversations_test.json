      "speaker": "Dhruti",
      "text": "Additionally, we need to develop a comprehensive waste management plan to handle radioactive materials responsibly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Daniel",
      "text": "I agree. Our approach to waste management will be critical in maintaining regulatory compliance and public trust."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Singam",
      "text": "We should also invest in research and development to improve extraction efficiency and reduce environmental impact."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sophia",
    "text": "I can start researching best practices and technologies that can help us achieve these goals."
    },
    {
